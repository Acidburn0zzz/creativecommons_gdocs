# creativecommons_gdocs
My attempts at writing an Add-on for Google Docs that will help select and import the license and logo. 
It will: 
1) Present as an Add-on
2) Take the user through this process:https://creativecommons.org/choose/
3) Insert an image for the license with a hyperlink to the license document
