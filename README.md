# creativecommons_gdocs
My attempts at writing an Add-on for Google Docs that will help select and import the CC license and logo. 
It will: 
1) Present as an Add-on
2) Take the user through this process:https://creativecommons.org/choose/
3) Insert an image for the license with a hyperlink to the license document

I would love to add but don't quite have the technical knowledge or time too:
1) Language support
2) Call the API instead of manually having the licenses in the code.gs file
3) Machine-readable format for better search capabilities
If you're interested in helping contribute I'd love to talk! brandon@opened.com
